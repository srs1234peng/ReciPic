# Recipe Recognition App

## Project Overview

This mobile application allows users to upload images of food items and receive recipe recommendations based on the ingredients detected in those images. The app uses a combination of local image processing and remote API calls to a backend server that performs recipe recognition and returns relevant recipes. It features user preference tracking and personalized recipe suggestions.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can either take a photo or select an image from their gallery.
- **Recipe Recognition**: Images are sent to a backend where ingredients are recognized and matched with available recipes.
- **Personalization**: User preferences are saved and used for tailored recipe suggestions.
- **Recipe Display**: Recipes are displayed along with their sources, indicating whether they are from the database ('DB') or generated by machine learning models ('LLM').

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For building the mobile application.
- **Expo**: Used to handle media picking and manipulation tasks.
- **Firebase**: For user authentication, storage, and real-time data management.
- **Node.js/Express**: Backend server for processing images and querying recipes.
